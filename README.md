#  University Management System â€“ C++ OOP Project

This is a **console-based University Management System** developed in **C++** as part of an academic project. The application simulates the operations of a university, focusing on **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** principles and **Data Structures**.

# OOP Concepts Demonstrated

The project is built around core OOP principles:

**Classes & Objects**
**Inheritance**
**Polymorphism** (Virtual functions & method overriding)
**Encapsulation**
**Abstraction**
**Composition** (Has-a relationships)
**Static Members**

# Features

**Add, view, and manage **students****
** Add **faculty** and assign **courses****
**Course enrollment** management
**Library system** for book issuance
**Attendance tracking** for students
**Marks and grade** management with **CGPA calculation**
** Collect and display **feedback****
**Address management** for students and faculty

# Technologies Used

**C++**
* Standard Template Library (`<vector>`, `<map>`)
* Console Input/Output
* No external libraries or GUI (console-based only)



# Purpose

This project is designed to:

* Simulate a basic university system
* Demonstrate real-world application of OOP concepts
* Provide a strong foundation for learning C++ and object-oriented design

Perfect for **academic use**, **learning projects**, or **interview preparation** involving OOP and basic data management.

# How to Run

1. Make sure you have a C++ compiler (e.g., `g++`) installed.
2. Compile the project:

   ```bash
   g++ -o university_system main.cpp *.cpp
   ```
3. Run the executable:
   ```bash
  ./university_system
   ```
